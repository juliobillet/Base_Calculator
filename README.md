# Base_Calculator

Base Calculator in TypeScript

This is a study I made to get to know TypeScript a little more.
Since I did this calculator using C a few weeks ago, which could run only in terminal, I challenged myself to do it using a new programming language. So I chose TypeScript, that I was sure from the beginning that it would be a real challenge seeing that I knew nothing of it.

It took a while and also a bunch of help of my friends Guilherme and Daniel.
They were real heros xD

As I did it in TypeScript I'm leaving all the TS things and files inside this git so you could give it a look on how I chose to do the things I did.

As I said up there, this is just a study small project I explored so I could discover more os TypeScript and its secrets 🗝

Hope you like it and also that it will help you convert some numbers into whatever base you want!
Have fun! 😊
(I sure did 😎)
